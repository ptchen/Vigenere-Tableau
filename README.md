# encipher-decipher

Develop an algorithm to build the Vigenere Tableau.
 Implement and execute the algorithm twice:
 (a) fill the two-dimensional array by rows;
 (b) fill the two-dimensional array by columns.
 
 Expand your algorithm to encipher and decipher text using the
 example given in the item above. Implement and execute your
 expanded algorithm as a single program.
